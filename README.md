  What is it?
  -----------

JSpellChecker is a 100% pure Java library implementing a spell checking algorithm
similar to aspell. It may be used to spell check a variety of sources.

JSpellChecker is based on FifeSoft SpellChecker, hence on Jazzy , one of the first Java spell 
checker. Indeed, 98% of the code is just Jazzy, with changes made for performance, bug fixes, and Java syntax.
